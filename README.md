# Front-End Foundations 🚀
**Hands-on projects from Angela Yu's "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp" (Udemy) – HTML/CSS section.**

Hey! I'm Harshal, a self-taught dev from India grinding through this bootcamp. Started with zero front-end experience, now building real pages. This repo tracks my progress daily. Check my recent commits for the streak! 💪

## 📋 Progress
- ✅ **HTML Basics** (structure, semantics, lists, forms, embeds)
- [ ] **CSS Fundamentals** (selectors, box model, positioning)
- [ ] **Advanced CSS** (Flexbox, Grid)
- [ ] **Bootstrap**
- [ ] **JavaScript** (DOM, events)

## 🛠️ What I've Built So Far
All in `html/` folder – open any `index.html` in browser to see:

| Project | What I Learned | Files |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| **Basic Portfolio** | Semantic HTML, images, links | `html-portfolio(basic)/`  |
| **Movie Ranking** | Ordered/unordered lists, basic styling | `movie-ranking.html` |
| **Birthday Invite** | Backgrounds, buttons, fonts | `birthday-invite.html` |
| **Contact Page** | Forms, textareas | `contact.html` |

## 🎯 Next Steps
Dive into CSS styling these pages, then Flexbox/Grid for layouts. Goal: Responsive portfolio by JS section.

**Live Preview**: Fork & enable GitHub Pages, or just open files locally.
